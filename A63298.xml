            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is obſerved, that frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples have not been hitherto ſufficient to deter ſome Perſons from committing Crimes, which render them lyable to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Juſtice; whoſe heavy ſtroak puts a Period to their Days with ſhame and diſgrace, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which, more than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has been obſerved; I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in the following Pages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Corniſh,</hi> a Perſon well known in the City of <hi>London,</hi> if not throughout the whole Kingdom, not weighing his Duty and Allegience to his lawful Severeign, at a time he was in a Station to ſerve his Prince: Being brought upon his Tryal, upon an Indictment of <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> found againſt him at the Seſſions Houſe in the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> and there pleading not Guilty; it was proved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93783:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>by ſufficient Evidence, that he was at a Meeting, where divers Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Propoſals were tendered; and that he was not only conniving, but conſenting thereto; to which, he only producing Evidence to prove his Behauiour, <hi>&amp;c</hi> was upon full Evidence in that Caſe found Guilty, and received Sentence as in Caſe of <hi>High-Treaſon.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> the 19th. of this Inſtant <hi>October,</hi> 1685. at the place aforeſaid, after which, being reconveyed to the County Goal of <hi>Newgate,</hi> he become very ſenſible of approaching Death; ſpending the time allowed him, in order to prepare himſelf for a future State in Pious Devotions, appearing much concerned at the miſery that had befallen him; confeſſing that his ſins had provoked the Almighty to ſuffer him to run into thoſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ways, that had brought him in the end, to ſhame and diſgrace; and ſo continued very penitent: When on <hi>Friday</hi> the 23th. of <hi>October,</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to a Warrant ſigned for his Execution, he was conveyed by the Sheriffs Officers to a Gibbet ſet up for that purpoſe, between <hi>Kings-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Soper-Lane</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide;</hi> and there after the Repetition of ſome Prayers, and the like, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Ring,</hi> being tryed at <hi>Juſtice-Hall</hi> in the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> the 19th of <hi>October,</hi> upon an Indictment laid againſt him, for harbouring, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, and maintaining <hi>Joſeph Kelloway,</hi> a Rebel and Traytor to his moſt ſacred Majeſty, knowing him ſo to be; as being one of thoſe actually in the Weſtern Rebellion, as likewiſe one <hi>Lawrence,</hi> another Rebel and Traytor; he knowing him ſo to be, which being plainly made out againſt him, and he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but a ſlender Excuſe or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was found Guilty of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Statute in that Caſe made and ptovided; after which, being rerconveyed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> he as the former became very penſive, conſidering his Latter End, and acknowledging that he had been a grievous ſinner; yet he hoped God would in the abundance of his mercy, pardon and forgive him, as he heartily deſired to forgive all the World; intreating ſuch as came to viſit him, (during the reſpit) to pray for him in their retirements, hoping as he ſaid, that in his laſt extremity it might prevail with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſupport and ſtrengthen him; and further proceeded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that for his ſins the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was to undergo had fallen upon him; and that he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than to bear it with patience: He was often obſerved to pray both publickly and privately whilſt he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and to ask Queſtions as to his eternal ſtate of ſuch as came to viſit him, and continued in a moderate temper, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his offence; But his Majeſty was pleaſed, out of his Royal Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and and Mercy to grant him a Gracious Reprieve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Gaunt,</hi> being Indicted at <hi>Juſtice-Hall</hi> in the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> upon an Indictment of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> on the 19h. Inſtant, for harbouring and comforting <hi>John Burton</hi> Out-Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> endeavouring to provide for his eſcape and flight from Juſtice; and thereupon put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf upon God and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it was proved that ſhe had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the ſaid <hi>Burton</hi> knowing him to be ſo Out-Law'd; to which ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very little to object, the Juriors upon the return of their Verdict, brought her in Guilty of the <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> as laid in the Indictment, and ſhe according to the Statute in that Caſe made, and provided, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sentence to be Burnt, after which, with a heavy Countenance returning to <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſhe as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer became very penſive, ſeeming much deſirous of Life at firſt, as it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93783:2"/>ſuppoſed, flattering her ſelf with hopes of a Pardon; but finding her offence admitted of no mercy, ſhe ſeriouſly reflected on her Latter End, often lifting her Eyes towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and extending her Arms, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the God of infinite mercies to pardon her ſins, and blot out all her tranſgreſſions; giving him praiſe that he had taught her to number her days, intreating him that ſhe might apply her heart to Wiſdom, and was often obſerved to retire, as much as the conveniency of the place would permit, and pray to her ſelf continuing that ſtate, till the day according to its ſpecification in the Warrant came for her Execution: When being conveyed to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the common place of Execution, ſhe was faſtened with a Cord to a Poſt a midſt a Pile of Faggots, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on fire after ſhe had been a while ſtrangled, ſhe was thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Linſey,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Alhallows Barkin,</hi> was Indicted the laſt <hi>Seſſions</hi> at <hi>Juſtice-Hall</hi> in the <hi>Old Bayly</hi> for deſerting his Colours; after his having betaken himſelf to his Majeſties ſervice, and received three ſhillings ſixpence Pay, which being proved againſt him, he was found Guilty, and Sentenced to dye, when upon his return to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he for a time ſeemed reſolute; but perceiving that his offence admitted neither Pardon nor Reprieve he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſomewhat ſerious, and began to reflect upon his paſt ill-ſpent life, ſaying, he had been a grievous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that for his many Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, God had brought him to ſhame and puniſhment, which, as he ſaid nevertheleſs hoped might redound to his advantage in another life; and ſo continued a ſenſe of his condition, both in <hi>Newgate</hi> and at the place of Execution, which, that it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others from the like diſregard and diſloyalty; whereupon a Gibbet Erected on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he ſuffered according to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> being tryed and found guilty, for Robing one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Anſlow</hi> on the High-Way, and taking from him divers things of value, received Sentence, and with the reſt being rconveyed to <hi>Newgate</hi> became more than ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the near approach of Death, being much deſirous to live, asking divers that came to viſit him, if they thought he ſhould be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but finding the day of diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at hand without any appearance of ſuch Grace and Favour; his Crime being of too high a Nature to admit his longer continuance on Earth; he much bewailed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy State, ſaying, that bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had inticed and drawn him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by degrees of ſin, till he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came bold therein; but that God by this affliction had made him ſenſible of his Latter End, and that he was but Duſt; therefore he earneſtly adviſed all that heard him, or beheld the ſad Example he was made, in forfeiting his Life to offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, thereby to take warning, and make it their buſineſs to live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not give heed to temptations of the like nature: He ſaid he was born of honeſt Parentage, and had good Education, but that he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed it, and through his Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Diſobedience, became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous in the World who, had he been ruled, might have lived hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and comfortable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Crompton,</hi> being tryed for Killing one <hi>Edward Herring,</hi> on the 20th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt upon a Reſcue, giving him a mortal Wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and plain proof being made out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he was found Guilty of wilful murther, and received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death: When returning to <hi>Newgate,</hi> in order to expect the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that Sentence; he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much concerned at his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and more for the Blood he had ſhed; ſaying, he had been Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sabbath-breaking and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs; for which, he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93783:3"/>that God being highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him, had ſuffered him to commit a Crime puniſhable with Death, yet he nevertheleſs hoped for mercy at the hands of his Creator, and that he ſhould be ſaved, through the meritorious Death and Paſſion of his Dear and Compaſſionate Saviour, deſiring the Prayers of his Viſitants; that God would ſtrengthen him patiently to undergo the puniſhment which for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the Law ſhould inflict upon him, being obſerved at ſundry times to give good heed and attention to ſuch expreſſions as were delivered, relating to his Eternal Well fare, and ſo continued to the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Preſby,</hi> being tryed upon an Indictment the preceedent Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for ſtealing 119 Yards of Cloath value at 36 <abbr>

               </abbr> out of the Ware-Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of St. <hi>Mary Hill,</hi> and upon proof that he had confeſſed it, was found Guilty; he received Sentence of Death, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before been Burnt in the Hand: He in <hi>Newgate</hi> during the reſpit, much exclaimed againſt bad Company, ſaying, that, that had been his ruin; eſpecially aſſociating himſelf with Leud Women; deſiring all Perſons, but more eſpecially the younger ſort to ſhun and avoid them, leaſt by their means, they were taken in the ſnare of inevitable ruin and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: Continuing very penitent, not only in <hi>Newgate,</hi> but at the place of Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catharine Brown</hi> of <hi>Twitenham,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> being try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the <hi>Old Bayly</hi> for Murthering her Baſtard Child, on the 4th of this Inſtant <hi>October</hi> and found Guilty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sentence as the former; ſhe in <hi>Newgate,</hi> greatly lamented her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate, ſaying, ſhe had been deluded and drawn away to commit uncleanneſs, and by retiring to avoid the ſhame and puniſhment of that offence ſhe had fallen into a greater, but was heartily ſorry for her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings; looking upon the Sentence ſhe lay under, to be the juſt reward of her ſins: She ſaid ſhe had been well Educated, and brought up by careful and indulgent Parents, but being of a rambling Diſpoſition; it was her misfortune to be over-come with fair Words to yield to lawleſs Embraces, but hoped God would forgive her that, and her other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys; pleaſed out of his Royal Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Mercy, to grant to her a Gracious Reprieve.</p>
            <p>On the 23th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1685. <hi>Richard Hooker, Elizabeth Gant, Samuel Preſby</hi> and <hi>Thomas Crompton,</hi> were conveyed to <hi>Tyburn;</hi> and there after praying a while, and the uſual Ceremonies performed, they were Executed according to Sentence.</p>
